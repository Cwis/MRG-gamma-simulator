# MRG-gamma-simulator
Full simulator code for magnetic-resonance-guided gamma imaging (MRG-γ)

## Work in progress
Currently the repository contains the source code for MR simulation of MRG-γ.
Configuration, phantom and sequence files will be added.
Installation and requirements guidance will be provided using Poetry.
The source code for the gamma simulation will also be added.
Detailed explanation will be given here, and a toy example with simulation data will be provided in a link to a Google Colab notebook.
